## üí™üèº Features

Some of the features the macro provides are:

* üõ°Ô∏è **In-game armor swap in just 1 second**: When the macro is activated, all the armor pieces currently worn by the player will be swapped with a new set prepared in the inventory within one second
* ‚å®Ô∏è **Customizable hotkey**: When starting the application, the user can define their own key or key combination for the hotkey to activate the macro
* ü™∂ **Lightweight application**: The application is very lightweight and takes up almost no storage space

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Virtual Environment & Dependencies

QuickArmorChange does require [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.10 on the machine in order to run.

After downloading the .zip file, extract the files and copy the root folder to a desired location (e.g. Desktop). 
After that, right-click the folder and select `Open in Terminal`. 
Then, try creating the virtual environment with the following command. 
If it fails because of restricting windows policies, you may activate the slider `Change execution policy` in the Windows-Settings under `System > For developers`, shown in the screenshot below:

    py -3 -m venv venv

![PowerShellSlider](img/settings_powerShellSlider.png)

After executing the last command you shouldn't get a response. Now you can activate the virtual environment with the following command:

    venv\Scripts\activate

A green command line prefix saying `(venv)` should appear. If so, install all the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## üöÄ Usage

To start QuickArmorChange, open the terminal in the QuickArmorChange folder like described in the installation guide and always activate the environment with `venv\Scripts\activate` before you run the application with the following command:

    py run.py


‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want to stop the running environment (venv) after using the application, just type `deactivate`.
